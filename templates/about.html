    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mohamed Shaahid, a 14-year-old student with a growing passion for technology, programming, and digital creativity. I started my journey learning Python and have since explored web development, game design, and automation.</p>
    <p>I enjoy solving real-world problems with code and have created tools like calculators, bill generators, and QR code makers. I also enjoy working with frameworks like Flask for web apps and Gradio for simple interfaces. Recently, I've started learning Roblox Studio and Unreal Engine for game development.</p>
    <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy solving math puzzles, exploring tech gadgets, and watching tutorials to level up my skills.</p>
